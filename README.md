This is a React boilerplate built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim is to keep it as simple as possible, but include libraries and conventions that we commonly use, and have them properly set up from the get-go!

## Requirements
* `npx`

## Libaries

* Scss: `node-sass 4.11.0`
* Routing: `react-router 4.3.1, react-router-dom 4.3.1, connected-react-router 6.3.1`
* Redux: `react-redux 6.0.1, redux-persist 5.10.0, reselect 4.0.0`
* Networking: `axios 0.18.0`

## Conventions

* We use Yarn! This is enforced with the `use-yarn` package, which prevents running `npm install` within the project

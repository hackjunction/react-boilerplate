This is a React boilerplate built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim is to keep it as simple as possible, but include libraries and conventions that we commonly use, and have them properly set up from the get-go!

## Requirements
* `npx`
* `yarn`

## Libaries

* Scss: `node-sass 4.11.0`
* Routing: `react-router 4.3.1, react-router-dom 4.3.1, connected-react-router 6.3.1`
* Redux: `react-redux 6.0.1, redux-persist 5.10.0, reselect 4.0.0`
* Networking: `axios 0.18.0`

## Conventions

* **Styling & CSS classnames** We like to use an adapted version of [BEM](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849) for consistent naming of css classes. It makes writing JSX very easy when the correct classname for each component is always evident, and makes writing css a breeze when you can intuitively remember what the classnames you set are. Plus, there's othing quite like the feeling of seeing your clean and organised code! Please see `STYLING.MD` for details on how to write css like a boss.

* **We use Yarn!** This is enforced with the `use-yarn` package, which prevents running `npm install` within the project

* **No semi-colons!** They're really not needed - once you get used to leaving them out, you'll save yourself a surprising amount of extra keystrokes
